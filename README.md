# Rust Learning

This is a learning repo for Rust language.  I'm working through ( https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html ) for the time being.

## Current TODO
Finish setting up dev environment apparently.

## Diary

2021/04/21, JDL:
Installing via https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Immediately ran into a problem saying that link.exe was missing and we needed VS2019.

We apparently need VS Build Tools with Visual C++ Option

This is a page on setting up a dev environment for Rust.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup#:~:text=On%20Windows%2C%20Rust%20requires%20certain,Rust%2C%20and%20not%20Visual%20Studio.

We selected VS Community 2019 and hit desktop C++ tools.   7 gigs... WTF...
